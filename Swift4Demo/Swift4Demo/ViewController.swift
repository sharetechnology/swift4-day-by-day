        /// its storage with the original string. The `Substring` type presents the
        /// same interface as `String`, so you can avoid or defer any copying of the
        /// string's contents.

        /// ==================================
        ///
        /// This example defines a `rawData` string with some unstructured data, and

        ///     // numericPrefix is the substring "126"
        ///
        /// When you need to store a substring or pass it to a function that requires a
        /// `String` instance, you can convert it to a `String` by using the
        /// `String(_:)` initializer. Calling this initializer copies the contents of
        /// the substring to a new string.
        ///

            return Int(s, radix: 10)! + 1
        }

        ///     // error: cannot convert value...

        print(incrementedPrefix)
        
        ///     // incrementedPrefix == 127
        ///
        /// Alternatively, you can convert the function that takes a `String` to one
        /// that is generic over the `StringProtocol` protocol. The following code
        /// declares a generic version of the `parseAndAddOne(_:)` function:
        ///
        
        func genericParseAndAddOne<S: StringProtocol>(_ s: S) -> Int {

        print(genericallyIncremented)
        ///     // genericallyIncremented == 127
        ///
        /// You can call this generic function with an instance of either `String` or
        /// `Substring`.
        ///
        /// - Important: Don't store substrings longer than you need them to perform a
        ///   specific operation. A substring holds a reference to the entire storage
        ///   of the string it comes from, not just to the portion it presents, even
        ///   when there is no other reference to the original string. Storing
        ///   substrings may, therefore, prolong the lifetime of string data that is
        ///   no longer otherwise accessible, which can appear to be memory leakage.
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
